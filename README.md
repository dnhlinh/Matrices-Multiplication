This is also referred to as a Dot Product.

This program allow you to enter the size of the 2 matrices, with the rule:
- Number in matrix A has the value of the sum of its position, for example:
        [0, 1, 2
         1, 2, 3]
- Number in matrix B has the value of the sum of its position multiplied by 2, for example:
        [0, 2, 4
         2, 4, 6]
